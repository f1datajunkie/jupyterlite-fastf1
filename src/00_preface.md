# Preface

The [`f1datajunkie/jupyterlite-fastf1`](https://github.com/f1datajunkie/jupyterlite-fastf1) template repository provides a reference guide for publishing a JupyterLite environment with a pyodide kernel capable of running `fastf1` (*not the live timing components*).

This makes it possible to work with `fastf1` purely in the browser; there are no requirements on installing any software to your own computer, and no requirement to access a fully-fledged Jupyter server.
