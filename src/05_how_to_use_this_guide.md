# How To Use This Repository

The repository is defined as a template repository, which means you can easily clone it and use it to construct your own JupyterLite environment.

The repository includes a Github Action that will build an appropriately configured JupyterLite site.

The intention is also to publish a pre-configured `xeus-python` kernel bubndling all required packages, but this is currently waiting on the appearance of a couple of packages in *emscripten-forge*.
