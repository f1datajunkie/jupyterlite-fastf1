# jupyterlite-fastf1

This template repository provides an example of running `fastf1` (*not live timing*) in a browser based JupyterLite environment. JupyterLite provides access to JupyterLab and Jupyert notebook environments, with ih-browser code exeuction using a Pyodide (WASM Python) environment.

*Although `xeus-python` kernels are availble for JupyterLite, `fastf1` currently only works in a `pyodide` kernel.*

In order to run `fastf1` in a `pyodide` envrionment, you need to manually install several dependencies. See the [`demo.ipynb`](./demo.ipynb) notebook for an example.

Guide to using this reposistory available as a Juopyter Book / ebook [here](https://f1datajunkie.github.io/book).

This template repository also includes a Github Action to create the JupyterLite environment and publish it to GitHub Pages. The action also publishes a Jupyter Book genereated from specified files in the repository to the `book/` path on the Pages site.
